+ repeatable and auditable workflow that can be published as endpoints to be called
+ alteryx check the data helth while browsing
+ auditing workflow: we can be checking how tool affects the data downstream
+ we need to import pandas to writeback to alteryx
+ can have all the business logic on data processing
+ from alteryx there can be a consumption by tableau, powerbi, jupyter...
